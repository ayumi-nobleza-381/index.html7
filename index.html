        <h2>Raven</h2>
        <p>The common raven (Corvus corax) is a member of a family of birds known as the Corvidae, which includes jays, crows, and magpies. In Alaska, the raven can only be confused with a hawk or the much smaller crow.</p>
        <p> It is part of a family of birds. Raven has a lot of symbolism in terms of life. Generally, birds play a big role in literature or could be a face of revolution.</p>

        <h2>Why Raven?</h2>
        <p>I like birds as a whole. They're what humans ought to be: Free. </p>
        <p>Why I chose Raven specifically? I chose Raven because they simply exist as they are. Ravens often represent ancient wisdom, intelligence, and transformation. They are used as messengers in different ancient myths and stories. They carry untold visions that will make the world go mad.</p>

    <div class="blog-post">
        <h2>Cages or wings?</h2>
        <p>"Cages or wings, which do you prefer? Ask the birds."</p>
        <p>It is a lyrical quote from the musical movie called "tick, tick... Boom!" As I said, humans long to be like birds. Free and just simply existing. There's a reason why birds are often a representation or face of revolutions. Ravens, they are spectral messengers, bearing the weight of untold visions and prophetic whispers. In the annals of mythology and folklore, these ebony enigmas inhabit a realm where symbols intertwine with human imagination.</p>
